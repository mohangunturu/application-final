MG

#### Executive summary
This research is going to help couples proactively to prevent/fix/take necessary steps to avoid divorce based on their answers to the questions in the dataset.

#### Rationale

Families serve as the foundational units of society, playing a crucial role in the well-being and development of individuals. Here are several reasons why supporting and nurturing families is essential for the stability and success of society:

Social Stability:
Families contribute to social stability by providing a stable environment for individuals, fostering a sense of belonging and security.
Emotional Support:
Families offer emotional support, care, and love, helping individuals cope with life's challenges and build resilience.
Child Development:
Families are primary in shaping the early development of children. A supportive family environment positively influences a child's cognitive, emotional, and social development.
Values and Morality:
Families often serve as the primary source for transmitting values, ethics, and cultural traditions. They play a crucial role in instilling a sense of morality and responsibility in individuals.
Education and Learning:
Families are the first educators, providing a foundation for learning and critical thinking. A supportive family environment encourages curiosity and a love for learning.
Economic Stability:
Strong families contribute to economic stability. Supportive family structures can provide financial stability, allowing individuals to focus on personal and professional development.
Community Building:
Families are building blocks for communities. Strong families contribute to the development of healthy and supportive communities.

#### Research Question
This research will help couples to predict the success rate of their marriage and help them proactively.

#### Data Sources

This the dataset that was collected from Kaggle from the the below url.

#### Methodology
I have used data exploration, data analysis, data cleaning, visualizations, handling missing and duplicate values, splitting the train and test data, and finally modeling by using regression models and classification models.

#### Results
My research finds that data helps to predict the divorces with above 90% of accuracy given a spouse answers the questions unbiased.

#### Next steps
Analyze this with ensemble techniqur by using bagging and boosting techniques and collect additional features that will help imrpving the accuracy of the models. Also, I would like to explore additional algorithms on this data to see if any other algorithms are performing better or worst than these.
