### What leads to divorce?

MG

### Executive summary
This research is going to help couples proactively to prevent/fix/take necessary steps to avoid divorce based on their answers to the questions in the dataset.

### Rationale

Families serve as the foundational units of society, playing a crucial role in the well-being and development of individuals. Here are several reasons why supporting and nurturing families is essential for the stability and success of society:

* Social Stability:Families contribute to social stability by providing a stable environment for individuals, fostering a sense of belonging and security.
* Emotional Support:Families offer emotional support, care, and love, helping individuals cope with life's challenges and build resilience.
* Child Development:Families are primary in shaping the early development of children. A supportive family environment positively influences a child's cognitive, emotional, and social development.
* Values and Morality:Families often serve as the primary source for transmitting values, ethics, and cultural traditions. They play a crucial role in instilling a sense of morality and responsibility in individuals.
* Education and Learning:Families are the first educators, providing a foundation for learning and critical thinking. A supportive family environment encourages curiosity and a love for learning.
* Economic Stability:Strong families contribute to economic stability. Supportive family structures can provide financial stability, allowing individuals to focus on personal and professional development.
* Community Building:Families are building blocks for communities. Strong families contribute to the development of healthy and supportive communities.

### Research Question
This research will help couples to predict the success rate of their marriage and help them proactively.

### Results: 
<p> LSTM and Logistic Regression are the best models for predicting the divorce close to 98% of the time with the 10 features that were selected. </p>
Below are 10 features. Select one option for each question to attain a predictive accuracy of 98% in predicting divorces using two widely-used and models that we explored out of many algorithms: Logistic Regression and LSTM network.

All responses were collected on a 5 point scale (0=Never, 1=Seldom, 2=Averagely, 3=Frequently, 4=Always).

1.My spouse and I have similar ideas about how marriage should be</br>
2.We're just starting a discussion before I know what's going on.</br>
Â 3.think that one day in the future, when I look back, I see that my spouse and I have been in harmony with each other</br>
4.We share the same views about being happy in our life with my spouse</br>
5.My spouse and I have similar values in trust</br>
6.My spouse and I have similar ideas about how roles should be in marriage</br>
7.I know my spouse's hopes and wishes</br>
8.I know my spouse's basic anxieties</br>
9.I can be humiliating when we discussions</br>
10.Most of our goals for people (children, friends, etc.) are the same.</br>

### Next Steps and Recommendations

* Visualizations:
    * I like to visualize more on overfitting, underfitting, bias and variance, other techniques to understand better

* Evaluate Model Performance:

    * I want to assess the  performance of these predictive models (Logistic Regression and LSTM network). Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to understand how well the models are performing on predicting divorces.

* Feature Importance Analysis:

    * I like to explore through feature importance analysis to understand which features have the most significant impact on the predictions. This can provide insights into the factors influencing divorce predictions.

* Model Interpretability:

    * I want to enhance the interpretability of these models to understand the reasons behind specific predictions.
      
* Error Analysis:

    * I like to analyze model errors and misclassifications. Identify patterns or trends in instances where the models are struggling to make accurate predictions, it may offer insights to get more data points.
* Fine-Tuning and Optimization:

    * I like to fine-tune these models based on the insights gained from the evaluation and analysis.(Ex: adjusting hyperparameters, experimenting with different feature sets, or exploring advanced techniques to optimize model performance).

* Validation on New Data:

    * I want to validate these models on new, unseen data to ensure that they generalize well, so that we can make sure the model is not overfitting.
* Deployment Strategy:

    * I want to create deployment strategy of my models. May be AWS or something else, I will leverage for this
* Continuous Monitoring:

    * I want to establish continuous monitoring of these models performance.
      
* Feedback Loop:

    * I want establish a feedback loop with end-users :) .
